# Project Structure
# As recommended in: https://github.com/alan2207/bulletproof-react/blob/master/docs/project-structure.md?plain=1

Most of the code lives in the `src` folder and looks something like this:

```sh
src
|
+-- app               # application layer containing:
|   |                 # this folder might differ based on the meta framework used
|   +-- routes        # application routes / can also be pages
|   +-- app.tsx       # main application component
|   +-- provider.tsx  # application provider that wraps the entire application with different global providers - this might also differ based on meta framework used
|   +-- router.tsx    # application router configuration
+-- assets            # assets folder can contain all the static files such as images, fonts, etc.
|
+-- components        # shared components used across the entire application
|
+-- config            # global configurations, exported env variables etc.
|
+-- features          # feature based modules
|
+-- hooks             # shared hooks used across the entire application
|
+-- lib               # reusable libraries preconfigured for the application
|
+-- stores            # global state stores
|
+-- testing           # test utilities and mocks
|
+-- types             # shared types used across the application
|
+-- utils             # shared utility functions
